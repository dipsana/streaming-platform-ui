## Overview

Hi! I'm **Dipsana**, and this is a **Netflix India (2023) inspired landing page** built to practice **HTML and CSS**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a static, dummy website. Features like sign-in, language selection, and other dynamic functionality **do not work**.

The page replicates the **look and feel of Netflix** using only **HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript is involved.
